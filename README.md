# Blender - Remove Duplicate Textures
 A simple addon to clean up copies of the same texture map

 I wasn't able to find an addon or feature to clean up files where you have multple textures in the file that are already loaded.
 Sometimes, you get many copies of the same texture, which bloats up your file. This solves that problem.
 It remaps to one copy of the file, and gets rid of the otheres. Should make the file smaller when you're including resources.

 You will find the addon in the file menu near the other cleanup items.

 This hasn't been tested a lot yet, but I will. So proceed with caution. So far, it seems to be working properly.
 If it happens to work for you, or not actually, please let me know.

 ChatGPT...wow.
